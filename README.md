# This repo contains the code for the Second Frontend Task

I used the react-redux, redux toolkit and createAsyncThunk libraries to read data from the provided api.

The data displays on the browser when the "click to display covid data is clicked".

The live link is found here [app link](https://redux-api-task.netlify.app/)


Since this task requires mostly implementation and on redux, I didn't focus much on styling the app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run the the code on localhost, clone the repo and cd in to the folder of the cloned repo

In the project directory, you can run: `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
